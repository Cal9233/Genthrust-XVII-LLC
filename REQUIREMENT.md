Design Philosophy: "Precision & Power"

The aesthetic will be sleek, modern, and technical, moving away from the more traditional look of the example site. We'll use a dark theme to create a premium feel, with your logo's colors providing striking accents.

Color Palette (Based on the GENTHRUST Logo):

Primary Background: Deep Charcoal or Dark Midnight Blue (a modern alternative to pure black).

Primary Accent: Electric Blue (from the logo's blue) for main buttons and highlights.

Secondary Accent: Deep Red (from the logo's red) for urgent CTAs or warnings.

Typography & UI Elements: Pure White and Light Grey for maximum readability against the dark background.
